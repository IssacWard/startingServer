# startingServer
_A custom Discord bot using Discord.js, Node, and Mongoose/MongoDB._

Primarily made to create custom embeds directly in discord servers and save them to MongoDB to be recalled when needed.

Later will create a single page web application for accessability in browser. 

**In progress! Working on the bot sending questions, recieving responses, and saving it to an object to send through AJAX.**
